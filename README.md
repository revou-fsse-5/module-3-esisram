## Progress Report for Random Recipe Finder

Project Title: [Random Recipe Finder] (https://spiffy-sundae-dde082.netlify.app/)
Submission Date: August, 9, 2024
Prepared by: [Esis Ramadhan](https://github.com/esisram)

## Implemented Functionalities

1. Recipe Fetching:

- Integrated with the MealDB API to fetch a random recipe when the user clicks the "Get Recipe" button.
- Displayed the recipe title, instructions, and image dynamically on the webpage.

2. User Interface:

- Created a simple and intuitive UI using HTML and CSS.
- Used event listeners to handle button clicks and update the DOM based on the fetched data.

3. TypeScript Integration:

- Converted the JavaScript implementation to TypeScript for type safety and better development practices.
- Defined a Recipe interface to ensure the correct structure of recipe data.

4. Error Handling:

- Implemented error handling to manage API fetch failures, displaying an appropriate message to the user if the recipe fails to load.

5. Styling:

- Applied basic styles to enhance the visual presentation of the recipe information.

## Challenges Faced

1. TypeScript Configuration:

- Initially encountered issues with TypeScript configurations, particularly with targeting ECMAScript versions and including the necessary libraries. This was resolved by creating a tsconfig.json file with the appropriate settings.

2. API Fetching:

- Faced challenges in error handling during the API fetching process, especially when the API response was not as expected. This was addressed by adding checks for response status and handling empty meal arrays.

3. Browser Compatibility:

- Ensured that the application runs smoothly in different browsers. This involved testing to confirm compatibility with features like async/await.

4. Dynamic DOM Manipulation:

- Managing dynamic updates to the DOM and ensuring that the displayed recipe information is user-friendly required careful attention to how elements were created and appended.

## Conclusion

The Random Recipe Finder application is functioning as intended, with all core functionalities successfully implemented. The application is capable of fetching and displaying random recipes from the MealDB API, providing a simple and interactive user experience.
